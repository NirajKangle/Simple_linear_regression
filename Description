In notebook 3, we have obtained the least squares solution of four families of polynomial models, namely polynomials of degree 1 (linear), 2 (quadratic), 3 (cubic) and 4.
Least squares is an exact method and provides the optimal model defined by the empirical error surface.

In notebook 4, we have obtained the least squares solution using polyfit function.
